# Amazon Sales Analysis: Data-Driven Product Launch Strategy

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of 110,000+ Amazon orders to provide actionable insights for optimizing product launch strategy, focusing on pricing and category selection.

## 🎯 Business Objectives
- Identify the optimal price point for a new product.
- Determine the most profitable product categories.
- Understand customer purchasing patterns.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Analysis:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Cleaning, Statistical Analysis
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git

## 📈 Key Insights
- The market is bifurcated into high-volume/low-price (e.g., ₹399) and low-volume/high-price segments.
- The **"Set"** category is the top performer, generating ₹35.7M in revenue—nearly double the next category—due to a high average selling price of ₹835.
- The average order value is ₹649, but this is skewed by premium products.

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations
1.  **Launch a "Set":** Compete in the high-value, high-volume segment by offering product bundles.
2.  **Price Strategically:** Target the ₹750-₹850 price range to align with the premium segment.
3.  **Consider "Western Dress" Niche:** A strong secondary option with high profitability and slightly less competition.

## 📁 Dataset
- The analysis is based on the "Amazon Sale Report" dataset.
- Due to GitHub's file size limits, the raw dataset is not included in this repository. The analysis can be reproduced by downloading a similar e-commerce dataset from platforms like Kaggle.
